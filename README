Contiguous Subset with Largest Sum Solution
-------------------------------------------

This problem can be solved with dynamic programming. The idea is to keep
track of the current maximum subsequence while transversing the list of
numbers once. This will result in a runtime of O(n) with constant memory as
only the beginning/end indices and sum must be stored in memory.

The program demonstrates a brute-force implementation and a dynamic programming
one. If there was more time, it would have been nice to benchmark performance
and have a nice little gnuplot comparing the two curves.

Files:
lss_bf.c - Brute-Force O(n^2) implementation with constant memory
lss_dp.c - Dynamic Programming O(n) implementation with constant memory
lss_test.c - Test cases
lss.h - Function headers and macros

Compiling:
make

Running:
./lss_test

There should be no output, as this means that the functions have passed all
the test cases.
